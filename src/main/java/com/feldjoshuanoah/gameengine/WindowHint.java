 * Window hints. There are a number of hints that can be set before the creation of a window and

 * set to their default values each time the library is initialized with glfwInit. Some hints are
 * platform specific. These are always valid to set on any platform, but they will only affect their
 * specific platform. Other platforms will ignore them. Setting these hints requires no platform
 * specific headers or calls. Some window hints are hard constraints. These must match the available
 * capabilities exactly for window and context creation to succeed. Hints that are not hard
 * constraints are matched as closely as possible, but the resulting context and framebuffer may
